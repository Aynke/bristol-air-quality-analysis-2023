Context

Measuring Air Quality
Levels of various airborne pollutants such as Nitrogen Monoxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (also called particle pollution) are all major contributors to the measure of overall air quality.

For instance, NO2 is measured using micrograms in each cubic meter of air (㎍/m3). A microgram (㎍) is one-millionth of a gram. A concentration of 1 ㎍/m3 means that one cubic meter of air contains one microgram of pollutant.

To protect our health, the UK Government sets two air quality objectives for NO2 in their Air Quality Strategy

The hourly objective, which is the concentration of NO2 in the air, averaged over a period of one hour.

The annual objective, which is the concentration of NO2 in the air, averaged over a period of a year.
